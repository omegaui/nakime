## Description
Nakime is a Windows session uptime tracker. It records **when your system was turned on**, **how long it stayed up**, **when it was shut down**, and the **idle time between sessions**. You can also view a graph of system uptime for a selected time period. 

Please view the video above to know more.

**Pro-tip**: Did you know? Nakime tracks sessions even without logging in, so you can see if someone tries to access your system while you're away.

# Technical Details
Nakime is built from scratch with three layers:

1. [Windows Service](https://github.com/omegaui/NakimeWindowsService) ‚Äì The core of Nakime, responsible for tracking uptime data.
2. Flutter Desktop App (The face of Nakime) ‚Äì A user-friendly interface to view the tracked data.
3. [Dart Command Line Tool](https://github.com/omegaui/uptime) ‚Äì A lightweight cli alternative for querying the live session data.

The first layer handles session data management, while the other two provide readable outputs.
The core service operates independently, while the other two layers rely on its data. If you modify the core‚Äôs data schema, you may need to update the Flutter app and CLI tool to prevent compatibility issues.

## Building from source

## App name inspiration
The name "Nakime" is inspired from a popular anime named "Demon Slayer", It's my favourite anime so far. If you have watched Demon Slayer, then you already know why I named this app after "Nakime", if not, then, you can search for "Nakime Demon Slayer" and see some videos of it, if you want ;)
